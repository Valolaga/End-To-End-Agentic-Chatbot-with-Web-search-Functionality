### End to End Project Agentic AI Chatbots
## Key Points for GitHub README
Here are concise, structured key points extracted and summarized from the repository's description and content. These can be directly adapted into your README.md file (e.g., under sections like "Features," "Tech Stack," "Installation," and "Usage"). I've formatted them as bullet points for easy copy-paste.
### Project Overview
- Title: End-to-End Agentic Chatbot with Web Search Functionality
- Description: A complete, autonomous AI agent chatbot that integrates web search capabilities to provide real-time, informed responses. Built for developers and enthusiasts to create intelligent conversational agents without relying on closed ecosystems.
- Goal: Demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for agentic AI, from user query handling to dynamic web retrieval and response generation.
### Key Features
- Agentic Design: Leverages AI agents for decision-making, tool selection, and task execution, enabling the chatbot to autonomously break down complex queries.
- Web Search Integration: Real-time web searching via APIs (e.g., SerpAPI or similar) to fetch up-to-date information, ensuring responses are current and factual.
- Conversational Memory: Maintains context across interactions using session-based memory stores for more natural, multi-turn dialogues.
- Modular Architecture: Easy-to-extend components for adding new tools, search providers, or LLM backends.
- Error Handling & Retry Logic: Built-in mechanisms for robust performance, including fallback responses if searches fail.
- Deployment Ready: Supports local runs and cloud deployment (e.g., via Docker or Streamlit).
